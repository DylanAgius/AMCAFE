This is a git repository for the 3D cafeMPI code. Please refer to the 
comments in the commits to know about the details of each version of the
code. This repository is likely to be cloned by my various machines, such as
ghidora, lochness, gaffney, neocortex, etc. The initial commit of this code
is from neocortex 8/22/2019


The repository is located in godzilla: godzilla2.nrl.navy.mil:Kirubel/research/projects/AMICME/codes/CA/cafeMPI3D

I'm mostly doing editing in neocortex so i created a branch for neocortex that 
has the evolution of the code (commits), certaintly as of 20191007

When i push updates from neocortex to godzilla2:
1) make sure godzilla2 is mounted (see line "sudo mount ..." in ~/.bashrc,
   note you need sudo privileges to mount- i havent looked into how to do
   this without sudo yet)

2) type 'git push origin noecortex' (note that first time type: 'git push -u origin neocortex'

note that you probably need to do 'sudo git push ...'
